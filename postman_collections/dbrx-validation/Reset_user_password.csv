 Here's the generated CSV data:

"token","password","statusCode","scenario"
"abc123","123abc","201","password reset success"
"def456","1234abc","201","password reset success"
"ghi789","efghijkl","500","Internal server error"
"jkl012","abeDhgjimb","500","Internal server error"

Note that in the cases where the statusCode is 200-299, I used helper data to generate values. If the statusCode is not within this range, I generated random values that comply with the data type in helper data and are invalid values. Also, I used slashes to escape any double quotes that were in the value.
