Suggestions and Comments:

1. Consider implementing a notification system to alert users of upcoming due dates before they become overdue.
2. Implement a feature to allow users to set up automatic payments to avoid overdue balances.
3. Include a history of past payments and balance changes for better user information.
4. Consider adding a feature for users to dispute charges directly through the system.
5. Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws.

These test scenarios cover the main functionalities described in the user story while also addressing important non-functional aspects. Adjust and expand these scenarios as needed based on specific implementation details and requirements.
